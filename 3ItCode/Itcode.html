                <p>I've programmed my resume as well as <br>
                  this website, using html, css and java script. <br>
                  I've always had my eyes on programming early <br>
                  on as I used to make games on scratch, which<br>
                  isn't really programming but tought<br>
                  me the basics and understanding of <br>
                  how programming works. After doing <br>
                  an Internship as an IT specialist for <br>
                  application development I learned the <br>
                  basics for C# and got the idea to do this <br>
                  as a job, as it was extremly fun.

            <button id="itbutton2close" class="itbutton2close">&times;</button>
              </div>
              <p>In this Internship I programmed a couple of  <br>
                cool things like: A Salecalculator that will<br>
                tell you how much money you save, if you<br>
                buy a product a certain amount of times for<br>
                a percentage off, a programm that you tell<br>
                what height and weight you have and if<br>
                that's healthy for your values or a <br>
                leapyearprogramm that tells you, if <br>
                a certain year is a leapyear or not.<br>
                Now I'm looking for an apprenticeship as<br>
                an IT specialist for application development <br>
                to learn more and become a professional.<br>
